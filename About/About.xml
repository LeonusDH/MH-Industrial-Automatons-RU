*Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2921585989]Mid-saver Saver[/url] to add safely due to the changes to certain biomimetic defs which may cause issues in some saves.
*You can attempt to clean your save and remove with Mid-saver Saver but it is strongly not recommended.

This mod reworks and expands upon features designed to be used or best operated with T1 and other biomimetic drones.
Additionally, various new industrial production chains are introduced that lean into utilising the mechanical products.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[b]Complete re-layout of the tech tree to highlight synergistic upgrades for drones[/b]
[b]Continuous Tread Leg [/b]
- Zippy speeds! Only for droids who do field work and never need to go near combat...
- Recommended for T1's
[b]Mechanical Production Chains[/b]
- Product Refinement Table for handling recipes
- Metallic textiles from Steel and Plasteel 
- Synthread production
- Mechanite harvesting for ways to eventually produce Luciferium and Hyperweave...

[b]Future Fun:[/b]
- Recharge Throne
--- A chair for unfeeling cooks to charge and cook at the same time! (Hideously uncomfortable...)
- Clankity Joints
--- Replacement joints with their own processors. 
--- Will cause droids to automatically adopt rakish spacecowboy poses and lounge indolently on couches.
--- Mildly amusing for your other pawns. Warning; may make T1's appear to have personality.

[b]Other Future Planned Stuff:[/b]
- Spacer tech production mimetics
- Android work gear
- More legs, arms, etc.

I am happy to incorporate other ideas if people have them.

[u]The following mods are special cases:[/u]
*EdB Prepare Carefully eventually breaks all custom pawns; but that's their problem.
*Combat Extended does their own compatibility patches; this [i]should[/i] be fine if they're patched for ATR.

[b]Can this be patched to work with -insert mod-?[/b]
[i]If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I may make patches if they're easy, but I won't be doing any messy patches myself though.[/i]

[b]Will you add the other localisations for other languages?[/b]
[i]As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.[/i]
